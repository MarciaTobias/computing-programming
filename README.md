# **Programming and Data Structures**

## Workbooks and Assignments from Computing Programming (Java)

This module teaches the learner how to design high-quality programs in a systematic way. All the relevant concepts and techniques are explained and exemplified in the clearest, simplest language. The module aims to introduce the learner to the concepts of programming and problem solving.
	
### 1. Introduction to Java Programming (Practical 1)
	
- Calculate Circle User Input: Calculates the area and the circumference of a circle radius given by the user.
	
### 1. Elementary Programming (Practical 2)
	
- Simples Calculation: The program uses two equations to find a result.
	
- Display Result: Program displays the result of adding the numbers from 1 to 9.
	
- Fraction Calculation: Display the result of adding fractions.
	
- Converts to Fahrenheit: Calculator that convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
	
- Add Integer: The program reads a random number between 0 and 100 and add all digits in the integer.
	
- Years Days: Converts minutes for years and days.
	
- Table Calculation: The program generates a table using loop and Math.pow.
	
- Current Time Date: The program displays the current time and date, using the System.CurrentTimeMillis() method.
	
- Random Upper Case: The program displays a random uppercase letter using the System.CurrentTimeMillis() method.
	
### 1. Selection (Practical 3)
	
- Display Days: The program that prompts the user to enter the month and year and displays the number of days in the month.
	
- Scissor Rock Paper Game: The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws.
	
- Checks Point: The program prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the rectangle cantered at (0, 0) with width 10 and height 5.
	
- Triangle: The program prompts the user to enter a point with x- and y-coordinates using JOptionPane and determines whether the point is inside the triangle.
	
- Kilograms Pounds: Calculator that convert kilograms to pounds.
	
- Largest Integer: The program displays the largest integer n such that n3 is less than 12,000.
	
- Characters: The program prints the characters in the ASCII character table from ! to ~.
	
- Pyramid: The program prompts the user to enter an integer from 1 to 15 and displays a pyramid.
	
- Nested Loops: The program uses nested loops that display the following patterns one after another.
